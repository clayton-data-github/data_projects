## About Me
I am Yu Chuan Teng, a data enthusiast with a deep interest in data science, machine learning, and AI. My experience spans a range of projects where I've applied advanced analytical techniques to derive insights and optimize strategies. This repository is a testament to my passion for leveraging technology to create impactful solutions.

## Projects

### MLB Player Data Mining
- **Description**: This project involves using an API connection to fetch player performance data directly from the MLB website. The data is then mined and analyzed to uncover trends and insights about player performance over time.
- **Tools Used**: Python, API Integration, Data Mining

### Automated Trading Portfolio
- **Description**: A comprehensive project that uses Python's Backtesting package to track various financial products. It includes sentiment analysis from news sources to respond to macro market changes, aiming to optimize financial portfolios for the best return, CAGR, and other key metrics.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Backtesting, Sentiment Analysis, Financial Portfolio Optimization, Risk Analysis

### Online Education Platform Subscription
- **Description**: This project involves end-to-end data analysis, starting with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and correlation analysis. Data wrangling techniques were applied to prepare the data for predictive modeling using algorithms such as Random Forest, SVC, and KNN, with the goal of predicting customer behavior and improving marketing campaigns.
- **Tools Used**: Python, EDA, Data Cleaning, Random Forest, SVC, KNN, Data Visualization

### Spaceship Business Report
- **Description**: Similar to the online education platform subscription project, this analysis focuses on optimizing predictions related to customer transportation preferences. The project uses customer behavior and information to develop a model that aids in decision-making for transportation services.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Optimization, Predictive Modeling, Data Analysis

### VannAI
- **Description**: In this project, I utilized an API connection to train VannAI, a large language model (LLM) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The model was trained to implement conversational methods for visual data extraction from Google Cloud, demonstrating the potential of LLMs in AI-driven data visualization.
- **Tools Used**: API Integration, LLM, RAG, Google Cloud, Vanna AI, SQL

## Technologies skills I have (more details on LinkedIn)
- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL, R
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
- **API Development**: Flask, Django, FastAPI
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Google Cloud
- **Database Management**: MySQL, MongoDB, Google Cloud, AWS
